## Getting Started

To run the example project, clone the repo and navigate to its root folder in
Terminal. Run the following command to install dependencies in their proper
location:

```Bash
pod install --project-directory=Example
```

## Use

### Measuring an On-Screen Element

To find out the dimensions of a `UIView` in an iOS app, use one of the following
properties:

#### Objective-C
```Objective-C
NSMeasurement<NSUnitLength *> *width = view.irl_physicalWidth;
NSMeasurement<NSUnitLength *> *height = view.irl_physicalHeight;
```

If a view is on a secondary screen (i.e. if youâ€™re using an external display)
the measurements will be returned as `nil`.

Of course, this also works nicely in Swift:

#### Swift
```Swift
let width = view.physicalWidth // type: Measurement<UnitLength>
let height = view.physicalHeight // type: Measurement<UnitLength>
```

### Sizing a View

If you want to ensure that a view matches a certain physical size, IRLSize provides
transforms to help you out:

#### Objective-C
```Objective-C
NSMeasurement<NSUnitLength *> *desiredHeight =
[[NSMeasurement alloc] initWithDoubleValue:38.0
                                      unit:NSUnitLength.millimeters];

view.transform = [view irl_transformForPhysicalHeight:desiredHeight];
```

#### Swift
```Swift
let desiredHeight = Measurement(value: 38, unit: UnitLength.millimeters)

view.transform = view.transform(forPhysicalHeight: desiredHeight)
```

### Measuring a Device

If you just want to know the physical size of the screen, use the category on
`UIDevice` for iOS or `WKInterfaceDevice` for watchOS:

#### Objective-C
```Objective-C
// iOS
NSMeasurement<NSUnitLength *> *screenHeight = UIDevice.currentDevice.irl_physicalScreenHeight;

// watchOS
NSMeasurement<NSUnitLength *> *screenHeight = WKInterfaceDevice.currentDevice.irl_physicalScreenHeight;
```

#### Swift
```Swift
// iOS
let screenHeight = UIDevice.current.physicalScreenHeight

// watchOS
let screenHeight = WKInterfaceDevice.current.phsyicalScreenHeight
```

## Installation

IRLSize is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```Ruby
pod "IRLSize"
```
